Natural gas is used to produce about 95% of Singapore's electricity, with the remainder generated from other sources such as diesel, waste incineration, coal and biomass. Please visit here for more information.


## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/energy-security/why-are-we-still-relying-on-natural-gas)

Why are we still relying on natural gas?
While solar energy is currently the most viable form of renewable energy for Singapore, intermittency and a lack of available land area limit its widespread adoption. As observed in various other countries, natural gas is an important fuel which will be needed as part of the global energy transition. 
Singapore will likewise need to rely on natural gas in the power system to ensure continued security and reliability in energy supply.


## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/solar/what-is-the-potential-of-solar-energy-in-singapore)

What is the potential of solar energy in Singapore?
Solar energy is currently the most promising renewable energy option for Singapore. It is clean, generates no emissions, and can boost our energy security. 
Being in the tropical sun belt, Singapore enjoys an average annual solar irradiance of 1,580 kWh/m2/year. EMA's aim is to potentially achieve 1.5GWp of solar deployment by 2025, and at least 2 GWp by 2030. Achieving our 2025 solar target of 1.5 GWp is equivalent to meeting the annual electricity needs of around 260,000 households in Singapore, or around 2% of our total projected electricity demand in 2025.
In the longer term, the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) has estimated that Singapore has the technical potential to deploy up to 8.6 GWp by 2050, which would constitute around 10% of the projected electricity demand then.

## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-the-use-of-hydrogen-for-electricity-generation)

Is Singapore considering the use of hydrogen for electricity generation?
The government had commissioned a study in 2019 to assess the technical and economic feasibility of importing and using hydrogen in Singapore and also outlined our national strategy in 2022 to develop hydrogen as a major decarbonisation pathway. 
This is to support Singapore's international climate commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Hydrogen has the potential to diversify Singapore's fuel mix towards low-carbon options for electricity generation by bringing in hydrogen produced from renewable sources or from sources with carbon capture. 
Low-carbon hydrogen may also be used in some industrial processes as a feedstock and as a fuel in heavy transportation. Depending on technological developments and the development of other energy sources, hydrogen could supply up to half of our power needs by 2050. 
However, global and diverse supply chains have yet to be established and Singapore will need to explore feasible options to import cost-competitive low-carbon hydrogen. An Expression of Interest was launched in December 2022 to assess the feasibility of developing an end-to-end solution for the use of low or zero-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen and ammonia, for power generation and bunkering solutions.


## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-the-use-of-geothermal-energy)

Is Singapore considering the use of geothermal energy?
EMA is exploring the potential of harnessing geothermal energy in Singapore, following new developments in technology. If found to be feasible, geothermal energy could serve as a new and additional source of indigenous clean energy besides solar for power generation in Singapore.
As a small resource-constrained country, Singapore has limited renewable energy options and imports almost all of its energy needs. Conventional hydrothermal systems, which harness heat from underground resources of hot water and/or steam, may not be applicable to Singapore due to the lack of quality resources at shallower depths. However, advances in technology such as Advanced Geothermal Systems have opened up the possibility of geothermal application in Singapore, by harnessing heat from deep hot dry rock, with minimal impact to environment and safety.

## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-the-use-of-carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage-ccus-technologies)

Is Singapore considering the use of Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage (CCUS) technologies?
Carbon capture, utilisation & storage (CCUS) is the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced from emission sources such as power plants, and converting it into usable products, or transporting it to a storage site and depositing it to prevent it from entering the atmosphere. This enables us to create greener energy as a result.
EMA recognises the challenges of adopting CCUS, and have plans to collaborate with industry and our research community to explore pilots and R&D initiatives to overcome them. Agencies had launched the Low Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative in 2021 to fund projects in areas such as Hydrogen and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). It aims to develop solutions that support decarbonisation of Singapore's power and industry sectors.

## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-nuclear-power-plants)

Is Singapore considering nuclear power plants?
A Pre-feasibility Study on Nuclear Energy concluded in 2012 that presently available nuclear energy technologies are not yet suitable for deployment in Singapore.
Newer nuclear power plant designs that are being developed and tested, such as the Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), may have the potential to be safer than plants that are in operation today. Compared to conventional large nuclear power plants, small modular reactors (SMR) promise enhanced safety and economics. Most of these technologies are still undergoing research and development and have not begun commercial operation. Some countries have announced plans for demonstrating some of these technologies in the coming decade.
EMA will continue to monitor the progress of these advanced nuclear technologies to keep our energy options open for the future and build capabilities to assess their implications for Singapore. Any decision to deploy new energy technologies will need to be considered against the technology’s safety, reliability, affordability, and environmental sustainability in Singapore’s context. In addition, these technologies will need to comply with stringent standards in line with the best practices of countries which have experience in ensuring the safety of such technologies.

## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-deploying-flexible-generation-technologies-such-as-floating-power-plants-or-mobile-power-plants)

Is Singapore considering deploying flexible generation technologies, such as Floating Power Plants or Mobile Power Plants?
Floating Power Plants (FPPs) are re-deployable floating units capable of power generation and export. FPPs consist of two major components: 
The power generation system(s)

The floating platform (typically barge or ship-based). Mobile Power Plants (MPPs) are truck/trailer-mounted or containerised power plants that can be equipped with the power generation system (e.g. gas turbine, reciprocating engines), switchgear and other balance of plant equipment.
Due to their mobility and modularity, FPPs and MPPs are flexible generation technologies that can be deployed for variable timeframes and relocated if Singapore decides to pursue other options. FPPs and MPPs can also be deployed quickly in Singapore by leasing it from the global market.

EMA is exploring the feasibility of these flexible generation technologies in Singapore's electricity market and the role it can play in supporting Singapore's energy transition. Learn more about Singapore's Energy Story and EMA's plans to create a cleaner energy future.

## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/energy-security/what-fuel-is-used-to-generate-electricity-in-singapore)

What fuel is used to generate electricity in Singapore?
Natural gas is used to produce about 95% of Singapore's electricity, with the remainder generated from other sources such as diesel, waste incineration, coal and biomass. Please visit here for more information.


## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/energy-security/why-are-we-still-relying-on-natural-gas)

Why are we still relying on natural gas?
While solar energy is currently the most viable form of renewable energy for Singapore, intermittency and a lack of available land area limit its widespread adoption. As observed in various other countries, natural gas is an important fuel which will be needed as part of the global energy transition. 
Singapore will likewise need to rely on natural gas in the power system to ensure continued security and reliability in energy supply.


## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/solar/what-is-the-potential-of-solar-energy-in-singapore)

What is the potential of solar energy in Singapore?
Solar energy is currently the most promising renewable energy option for Singapore. It is clean, generates no emissions, and can boost our energy security. 
Being in the tropical sun belt, Singapore enjoys an average annual solar irradiance of 1,580 kWh/m2/year. EMA's aim is to potentially achieve 1.5GWp of solar deployment by 2025, and at least 2 GWp by 2030. Achieving our 2025 solar target of 1.5 GWp is equivalent to meeting the annual electricity needs of around 260,000 households in Singapore, or around 2% of our total projected electricity demand in 2025.
In the longer term, the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) has estimated that Singapore has the technical potential to deploy up to 8.6 GWp by 2050, which would constitute around 10% of the projected electricity demand then.

Electricity from solar can vary based on factors such as the amount of sunlight, cloud movement and shade.
Refer to the Solar Irradiance Map for the solar irradiance variations across Singapore.


## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-the-use-of-hydrogen-for-electricity-generation)

Is Singapore considering the use of hydrogen for electricity generation?
The government had commissioned a study in 2019 to assess the technical and economic feasibility of importing and using hydrogen in Singapore and also outlined our national strategy in 2022 to develop hydrogen as a major decarbonisation pathway. 
This is to support Singapore's international climate commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Hydrogen has the potential to diversify Singapore's fuel mix towards low-carbon options for electricity generation by bringing in hydrogen produced from renewable sources or from sources with carbon capture. 
Low-carbon hydrogen may also be used in some industrial processes as a feedstock and as a fuel in heavy transportation. Depending on technological developments and the development of other energy sources, hydrogen could supply up to half of our power needs by 2050. 
However, global and diverse supply chains have yet to be established and Singapore will need to explore feasible options to import cost-competitive low-carbon hydrogen. An Expression of Interest was launched in December 2022 to assess the feasibility of developing an end-to-end solution for the use of low or zero-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen and ammonia, for power generation and bunkering solutions.


## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-the-use-of-geothermal-energy)

Is Singapore considering the use of geothermal energy?
EMA is exploring the potential of harnessing geothermal energy in Singapore, following new developments in technology. If found to be feasible, geothermal energy could serve as a new and additional source of indigenous clean energy besides solar for power generation in Singapore.
As a small resource-constrained country, Singapore has limited renewable energy options and imports almost all of its energy needs. Conventional hydrothermal systems, which harness heat from underground resources of hot water and/or steam, may not be applicable to Singapore due to the lack of quality resources at shallower depths. However, advances in technology such as Advanced Geothermal Systems have opened up the possibility of geothermal application in Singapore, by harnessing heat from deep hot dry rock, with minimal impact to environment and safety.

## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-the-use-of-carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage-ccus-technologies)

Is Singapore considering the use of Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage (CCUS) technologies?
Carbon capture, utilisation & storage (CCUS) is the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced from emission sources such as power plants, and converting it into usable products, or transporting it to a storage site and depositing it to prevent it from entering the atmosphere. This enables us to create greener energy as a result.
EMA recognises the challenges of adopting CCUS, and have plans to collaborate with industry and our research community to explore pilots and R&D initiatives to overcome them. Agencies had launched the Low Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative in 2021 to fund projects in areas such as Hydrogen and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). It aims to develop solutions that support decarbonisation of Singapore's power and industry sectors.

## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-nuclear-power-plants)

Is Singapore considering nuclear power plants?
A Pre-feasibility Study on Nuclear Energy concluded in 2012 that presently available nuclear energy technologies are not yet suitable for deployment in Singapore.
Newer nuclear power plant designs that are being developed and tested, such as the Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), may have the potential to be safer than plants that are in operation today. Compared to conventional large nuclear power plants, small modular reactors (SMR) promise enhanced safety and economics. Most of these technologies are still undergoing research and development and have not begun commercial operation. Some countries have announced plans for demonstrating some of these technologies in the coming decade.
EMA will continue to monitor the progress of these advanced nuclear technologies to keep our energy options open for the future and build capabilities to assess their implications for Singapore. Any decision to deploy new energy technologies will need to be considered against the technology’s safety, reliability, affordability, and environmental sustainability in Singapore’s context. In addition, these technologies will need to comply with stringent standards in line with the best practices of countries which have experience in ensuring the safety of such technologies.

## EMA FAQs: Energy Supply (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-supply/low-carbon-alternatives/is-singapore-considering-the-use-of-wind-energy)

Is Singapore considering the use of wind energy?
Most commercial wind turbines operate at average wind speeds of at least 4.5 m/s. On the other hand, the average wind speed in Singapore is only about 2-3 m/s. 
Hence, there is low potential of using wind for power generation in Singapore based on existing technology. In addition, there are challenges to harnessing offshore winds due to busy maritime traffic in our waters.
Singapore installed its first long-span wind turbine at Semakau Landfill in 2017 as part of NTU's Renewable Energy Integration Demonstrator - Singapore (REIDS) initiative. EMA will continue to monitor the development of wind technologies.
