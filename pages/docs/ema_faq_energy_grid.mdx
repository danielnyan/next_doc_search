## EMA FAQs: Energy Grid (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/energy-grid/grid-resilience/is-singapores-existing-electricity-network-adequate-to-support-electric-vehicle-ev-charging-infrastructure)

Is Singapore's existing electricity network adequate to support Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure?
EMA is working with LTA and local researchers to study the long-term electrical infrastructure needs for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging.
Preliminary findings show that upgrades will be required at various levels - the consumer intake substations at the local level, the distribution grid network, as well as power generation. The required upgrades will be implemented over the next two decades.
It will be possible to estimate the requirements more precisely over time as more data are gathered on charging behaviour with the proliferation of EVs, and continual improvement in the technology for EV batteries and chargers. In addition, smart charging solutions which can reduce the impact of EV charging on the grid are also being explored.
