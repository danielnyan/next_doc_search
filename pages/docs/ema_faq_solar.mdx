## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/how-do-i-know-if-my-rooftop-is-suitable-for-solar-pv-installation)

How do I know if my rooftop is suitable for solar PV installation?
Most roofs are suitable for solar PV. However, roofs that are overly sloped or complex (e.g. with many build-ups that could cast shade on the PV system or roof with many small patches rather than one single large roof area) would not be the most ideal for solar PV installations. 
You can refer to National Solar Repository of Singapore  for the list of vendors you can reach out to in assessing the suitability of your rooftop for solar PV installation.
To get an impression of what types of PV systems are installed in Singapore, you may also check out some of the existing PV installations on the National Solar Repository website.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/do-i-need-to-make-any-alterations-to-my-roof-before-installing-solar-panels)

Do I need to make any alterations to my roof before installing solar panels?
Typically, no alterations are required. In cases where the roof has a water proofing layer, it might be worthwhile to first re-do the water proofing, so that the system does not need to be removed at a later stage when the periodic water-proofing is due.
A site check will usually be conducted by your solar installer prior to your solar panel installation to determine if any preparatory works are required.

## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/can-i-be-paid-for-excess-solar-generated-electricity-sold-back-to-the-grid)

Can I be paid for excess solar-generated electricity sold back to the grid?
Consumers with solar PV system can be paid for excess solar-generated electricity sold back to the grid. The payment mode will depend on the contestability status and its installed capacity. For non-contestable consumers, any solar energy produced is first used to offset your own consumption during that period. 
Any excess solar energy will then be exported to the grid. You will receive payment (based on the prevailing low-tension electricity tariff minus grid charge) from SP Group by way of a credit adjustment to the monthly electricity bill. For contestable consumers, you may register via the Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS) to be paid the average nodal price via SP Group for the excess solar electricity sold back to the grid. 
Alternatively, you can also register with the Energy Market Company (EMC) to receive payment for excess solar electricity sold back to the grid based on the prevailing nodal prices. Visit the Solar Installation Guide section for the payment schemes available and other relevant details.

What are the various payment schemes available to solar consumers to sell back excess solar generated electricity?
If the consumer owns a solar PV system and wishes to sell any excess solar electricity to the grid, depending on their contestability status, they may either:

Register with SP Services (SPS) under the Simplified Credit Treatment (SCT) or Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS) by requesting the LEW to submit the relevant applications to SP Services
Directly register with the Energy Market Company as a Market Participant, or
Appoint another Market Participant (not applicable to residential consumers)

Consumers with embedded solar photovoltaic generation can opt for an estimated solar generation output instead of installing the relevant metering arrangement (‘M1 Meters’) at each generation point. The Solar Generation Profile is approved by the Energy Market Authority and is based on factors such as Singapore’s historical average solar irradiance from 7am to 7pm. 

For more information you can refer to the approved solar generation profile at the EMA website. Please note that the profile does not apply to building owners who choose to have a solar leasing agreement with an appointed solar vendor.

How long does it take to complete a residential solar PV installation?
Solar PV system installation for a landed property usually takes 1-2 weeks, which is also dependent on weather conditions.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/how-long-will-a-solar-pv-system-last)

How long will a solar PV system last?
Solar PV systems are designed to be extremely durable and last for at least 30 years. Most solar panels have a warranty period of 25 to 30 years, and inverters have a warranty period of 5 to 12 years.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/how-long-is-the-warranty-on-my-solar-pv-system)

How long is the warranty on my solar PV system?
Both your solar panels and inverters have their own warranties.
For PV modules there are two types of warranties:

A product warranty, which covers defects on the solar panels. For that, the industry standard is 5-10 years, with selected manufactures offering up to 20 years.
A power output warranty, which covers cases where the power output falls below the guaranteed levels. For that, industry standard is 20-25 years, with selected glass-glass module manufacturers even providing 30 years.

Within this period, the under-performing solar panels will be replaced, or the owner gets compensated for the associated losses. 
On the other hand, solar inverters are more complex and hence have shorter warranty periods of 5 to 12 years. However, as solar inverters are easily accessible, they can be swapped out when required.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/is-the-warranty-tied-to-the-solar-panel-manufacturer-or-the-solar-installers)

Is the warranty tied to the solar panel manufacturer or the solar installers?
Warranties on your solar panels and inverters are registered with the manufacturers. However, you can rely on your solar installers to contact the manufacturers and settle any replacements covered by the warranties on your behalf. In the rare occasion where your solar installer is no longer in operation, you may have to contact the manufacturer directly.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/how-much-does-it-cost-to-deploy-solar-panels-for-my-building-if-i-decide-to-go-for-an-ownership-model)

How much does it cost to deploy solar panels for my building, if I decide to go for an ownership model?
The cost of deploying solar varies depending on the size of the solar PV system, the type of panels used as well as the type of application. The overall upfront cost for a rooftop PV system can range from S$1 to S$1.4/Wp depending on the size of the system. Smaller systems are relatively more expensive than larger systems. For example, a 10 kWp residential rooftop PV system can cost around S$1,540/kWp while a 1,000 kWp industrial rooftop PV system can cost around S$940/kWp. The operation and maintenance costs range between 1 to 1.45% of upfront costs (1% for large rooftop systems compared to 1.45% for smaller systems).
For more cost information you can refer to the National Solar Repository website or reach out directly to solar vendors to compare quotes.
While the upfront costs of solar can be significant, these costs can be recovered through electricity generated by the solar PV system over its lifespan. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of solar is a well-established method in energy finance and policy to calculate the cost of solar electricity generation by dividing the entire lifecycle cost of a solar PV system by its cumulative solar electricity generation. Based on estimates, the LCOE for small scale rooftop solar PV ranges from $0.11/kWh - $0.15/kWh. In comparison, the regulated tariff, which reflects the cost of electricity sold by SP Group is $0.25/kWh for 3Q2021.
The Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) also offers a LCOE calculator that provides an indication of the LCOE of a solar PV investment.

How long is the payback period for a residential solar PV system, if I decide to go with an ownership model?
The average payback period for a residential solar PV system is about 7 years. However, this largely depends on the size of your solar PV system, which part of the day you use the most electricity and how much electricity you use overall. Households who have a large solar PV system and use a lot of electricity, especially in the daytime, can see payback periods of as short as 4 to 5 years.

## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/how-do-i-know-if-my-rooftop-is-suitable-for-solar-pv-installation)

How do I know if my rooftop is suitable for solar PV installation?
Most roofs are suitable for solar PV. However, roofs that are overly sloped or complex (e.g. with many build-ups that could cast shade on the PV system or roof with many small patches rather than one single large roof area) would not be the most ideal for solar PV installations. 
You can refer to National Solar Repository of Singapore  for the list of vendors you can reach out to in assessing the suitability of your rooftop for solar PV installation.
To get an impression of what types of PV systems are installed in Singapore, you may also check out some of the existing PV installations on the National Solar Repository website.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/do-i-need-to-make-any-alterations-to-my-roof-before-installing-solar-panels)

Do I need to make any alterations to my roof before installing solar panels?
Typically, no alterations are required. In cases where the roof has a water proofing layer, it might be worthwhile to first re-do the water proofing, so that the system does not need to be removed at a later stage when the periodic water-proofing is due.
A site check will usually be conducted by your solar installer prior to your solar panel installation to determine if any preparatory works are required.

## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/do-i-need-to-own-the-solar-pv-system-that-is-installed-on-my-building)

Do I need to own the solar PV system that is installed on my building?
Building owners can choose to own the solar PV system, which is more common amongst landed property owners.
An alternative is to explore a ‘Solar Leasing’ agreement with a solar vendor. Depending on the size of the rooftop, solar PV vendors offer the option of a Solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), often referred to as a ‘Solar Leasing’ agreement.
Under such an agreement,

The solar PV vendor will own and install the solar PV system on the building at no upfront capital costs to the building owner. In return for availing the space for solar PV deployment, the building owner can enjoy a discounted rate off their existing electricity tariff.
The solar PV vendor will often undertake the operating costs and risks for the solar PV system, as well as monetary benefits from the various solar payment schemes.

## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/are-there-subsidies-provided-for-solar-energy)

Are there subsidies provided for solar energy?
Adopting subsidies such as feed-in tariffs for solar energy distorts the energy markets. It increases costs for consumers. Hence, it is important to price energy correctly and send the right price signals to both consumers and investors.
Instead of subsidies, Singapore has taken proactive steps to introduce regulatory enhancements to facilitate the entry of renewable energy.
For more information, you may wish to refer to the Solar Installation Guide section.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/is-there-any-grant-available-for-solar-deployment-on-buildings)

Is there any grant available for solar deployment on buildings?
With technological advances, the cost of solar panels has decreased over time. The cost of solar energy is now generally cheaper than the retail electricity price and regulated tariff. Hence, the Government does not provide grants or subsidies to further incentivize the adoption of solar energy.
For energy efficiency grants, you may find out more about the Building Retrofit Energy Efficiency Financing (BREEF) scheme.
You may also wish to visit BCA's BuildSG Transformation Fund webpage which lists the various schemes (apart from those related to energy efficiency financing), to see if there is any other suitable schemes for your project there.

## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/can-i-be-paid-for-excess-solar-generated-electricity-sold-back-to-the-grid)

Can I be paid for excess solar-generated electricity sold back to the grid?
Consumers with solar PV system can be paid for excess solar-generated electricity sold back to the grid. The payment mode will depend on the contestability status and its installed capacity. For non-contestable consumers, any solar energy produced is first used to offset your own consumption during that period. 
Any excess solar energy will then be exported to the grid. You will receive payment (based on the prevailing low-tension electricity tariff minus grid charge) from SP Group by way of a credit adjustment to the monthly electricity bill. For contestable consumers, you may register via the Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS) to be paid the average nodal price via SP Group for the excess solar electricity sold back to the grid. 
Alternatively, you can also register with the Energy Market Company (EMC) to receive payment for excess solar electricity sold back to the grid based on the prevailing nodal prices. Visit the Solar Installation Guide section for the payment schemes available and other relevant details. For assistance, contact SP Group at powerfeedback@spgroup.com.sg  or call 1800 222 2333.

What are the various payment schemes available to solar consumers to sell back excess solar generated electricity?
If the consumer owns a solar PV system and wishes to sell any excess solar electricity to the grid, depending on their contestability status, they may either:

Register with SP Services (SPS) under the Simplified Credit Treatment (SCT) or Enhanced Central Intermediary Scheme (ECIS) by requesting the LEW to submit the relevant applications to SP Services
Directly register with the Energy Market Company as a Market Participant, or
Appoint another Market Participant (not applicable to residential consumers)

Consumers with embedded solar photovoltaic generation can opt for an estimated solar generation output instead of installing the relevant metering arrangement (‘M1 Meters’) at each generation point. The Solar Generation Profile is approved by the Energy Market Authority and is based on factors such as Singapore’s historical average solar irradiance from 7am to 7pm. 

For more information you can refer to the approved solar generation profile at the EMA website. Please note that the profile does not apply to building owners who choose to have a solar leasing agreement with an appointed solar vendor.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/how-long-does-it-take-to-complete-a-residential-solar-pv-installation)

How long does it take to complete a residential solar PV installation?
Solar PV system installation for a landed property usually takes 1-2 weeks, which is also dependent on weather conditions.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/how-long-will-a-solar-pv-system-last)

How long will a solar PV system last?
Solar PV systems are designed to be extremely durable and last for at least 30 years. Most solar panels have a warranty period of 25 to 30 years, and inverters have a warranty period of 5 to 12 years.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/how-long-is-the-warranty-on-my-solar-pv-system)

How long is the warranty on my solar PV system?
Both your solar panels and inverters have their own warranties.
For PV modules there are two types of warranties:

A product warranty, which covers defects on the solar panels. For that, the industry standard is 5-10 years, with selected manufactures offering up to 20 years.
A power output warranty, which covers cases where the power output falls below the guaranteed levels. For that, industry standard is 20-25 years, with selected glass-glass module manufacturers even providing 30 years.

Within this period, the under-performing solar panels will be replaced, or the owner gets compensated for the associated losses. 
On the other hand, solar inverters are more complex and hence have shorter warranty periods of 5 to 12 years. However, as solar inverters are easily accessible, they can be swapped out when required.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/is-the-warranty-tied-to-the-solar-panel-manufacturer-or-the-solar-installers)

Is the warranty tied to the solar panel manufacturer or the solar installers?
Warranties on your solar panels and inverters are registered with the manufacturers. However, you can rely on your solar installers to contact the manufacturers and settle any replacements covered by the warranties on your behalf. In the rare occasion where your solar installer is no longer in operation, you may have to contact the manufacturer directly.


## EMA FAQs: Solar (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/solar/solar-installation-guide/how-much-does-it-cost-to-deploy-solar-panels-for-my-building-if-i-decide-to-go-for-an-ownership-model)

How much does it cost to deploy solar panels for my building, if I decide to go for an ownership model?
The cost of deploying solar varies depending on the size of the solar PV system, the type of panels used as well as the type of application. The overall upfront cost for a rooftop PV system can range from S$1 to S$1.4/Wp depending on the size of the system. Smaller systems are relatively more expensive than larger systems. For example, a 10 kWp residential rooftop PV system can cost around S$1,540/kWp while a 1,000 kWp industrial rooftop PV system can cost around S$940/kWp. The operation and maintenance costs range between 1 to 1.45% of upfront costs (1% for large rooftop systems compared to 1.45% for smaller systems).
For more cost information you can refer to the National Solar Repository website or reach out directly to solar vendors to compare quotes.
While the upfront costs of solar can be significant, these costs can be recovered through electricity generated by the solar PV system over its lifespan. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of solar is a well-established method in energy finance and policy to calculate the cost of solar electricity generation by dividing the entire lifecycle cost of a solar PV system by its cumulative solar electricity generation. Based on estimates, the LCOE for small scale rooftop solar PV ranges from $0.11/kWh - $0.15/kWh. In comparison, the regulated tariff, which reflects the cost of electricity sold by SP Group is $0.25/kWh for 3Q2021.
The Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) also offers a LCOE calculator that provides an indication of the LCOE of a solar PV investment.

How long is the payback period for a residential solar PV system, if I decide to go with an ownership model?
The average payback period for a residential solar PV system is about 7 years. However, this largely depends on the size of your solar PV system, which part of the day you use the most electricity and how much electricity you use overall. Households who have a large solar PV system and use a lot of electricity, especially in the daytime, can see payback periods of as short as 4 to 5 years.
