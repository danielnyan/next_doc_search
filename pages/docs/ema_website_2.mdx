What is the role of conventional generators in compensating for solar energy shortfalls?

Conventional generators play a role in compensating for solar energy shortfalls by providing backup power when solar energy output drops. For example, if a moving cloud causes a sudden drop in solar energy output, conventional generators need to be on standby to meet the resulting shortfall. This backup ensures that electricity supply remains uninterrupted, preventing blackouts and maintaining grid stability.

Why is managing intermittency crucial for solar energy generation?

Managing intermittency is crucial for solar energy generation because the output of solar PV systems is variable and dependent on weather conditions. Solar energy production can be affected by factors like sunlight, cloud cover, and shadows. To ensure grid stability and reliability, measures must be in place to compensate for variations in solar output and balance supply and demand effectively.
