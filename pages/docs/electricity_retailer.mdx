Application Details  
Required for the retail of electricity to contestable customers  
https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/browse-all-licences/energy-market-authority-(ema)/electricity-retailer

Retail electricity licensees (electricity retailers) are entities authorised by the Energy MarketAuthority (EMA) to retail electricity to contestable customers.  
There are two types of electricity retailers: Market Participant Retailers (MPRs) and Non-Market Participant Retailers (NMPRs).  
MPRs have to be registered with the Energy Market Company (EMC) to purchase electricityfrom the National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) to sell to contestable consumers.  
NMPRs need not register with EMC to participate in the NEMS, as they will purchaseelectricity indirectly from the NEMS through the Market Support Services Licensee (MSSL).  
For more information on becoming a retailer, you may refer to EMA's Guide to Becoming a Licensed Electricity Retailer available via https://www.ema.gov.sg/regulations-licences/licences/industry-licences

A new electricity retailer applicant will need to first apply for a provisional licence which is valid for 1 year. During this period, the licensee shall need to fulfil the stipulated requirements needed to apply for a full electricity retailer licence. A full electricity retailerlicence will be granted upon fulfilment of the stipulated requirements prior to the expiry ofthe provisional licence. For more information regarding the requirements, you may refer tothe Open Electricity Market's website (www.openelectricitymarket.sg)
