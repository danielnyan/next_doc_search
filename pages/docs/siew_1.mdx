What is the role of conventional generators in managing solar energy intermittency in Singapore?

Conventional generators play a crucial role in managing solar energy intermittency in Singapore. As solar energy output is variable and dependent on weather conditions, conventional generators act as backup reserves to compensate for any shortfalls in solar power generation. They ensure that the power grid remains stable and reliable, preventing blackouts or disruptions. Effective coordination between solar PV systems and conventional generators is essential to maintain grid stability.

What is the role of energy storage solutions in managing solar energy intermittency in Singapore?

Energy storage solutions play a vital role in managing solar energy intermittency in Singapore. They help store excess solar energy during periods of high generation and release it when solar generation is low or affected by weather conditions. By providing a buffer, energy storage systems enable a more stable and reliable supply of electricity, compensating for fluctuations in solar power output. This enhances grid stability, reduces reliance on conventional generators, and maximizes the utilization of solar energy.
