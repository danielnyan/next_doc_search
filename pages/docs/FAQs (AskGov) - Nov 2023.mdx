15	Electricity & Gas Tariffs	What is electricity tariff?	"The [electricity tariff](https://www.ema.gov.sg/Residential_Electricity_Tariffs.aspx) is the price at which consumers buy electricity from SP Group. It is reviewed every quarter, and is regulated by EMA to reflect the actual cost of electricity.

For more information on the latest tariff breakdown for the different tension levels, visit [SP Group](https://www.spgroup.com.sg/our-services/utilities/tariff-information) for the information.

With Open Electricity Market (OEM), consumers who have switched to buying electricity from a retailer of their choice can enjoy discounts off the regulated tariff. Visit the [OEM website](https://www.openelectricitymarket.sg/home) for more information on your electricity purchase options."

S/N	Topic	Question	AskGov Response	
16	Electricity & Gas Tariffs	How is electricity tariff determined?	"There are two key components of the electricity tariff - fuel cost and non-fuel cost. 

The fuel cost component for each quarter is calculated using the average of daily natural gas prices in the first two-and-a-half month period in the preceding quarter.

The non-fuel cost component reflects the cost of generating and delivering electricity to homes. It comprises mainly the grid charge, and the capital and operating costs of generation companies.

There is a time lag in the gas price reflected in the electricity tariff because changes in gas prices in the current quarter will only be taken into account in the next quarter's tariff. This means that any increase or decrease in gas prices in the current quarter will only be reflected in the next quarter's tariff.

19	Electricity & Gas Tariffs	Are electricity prices in Singapore subsidised?	"In Singapore, the price of electricity is not subsidised.  This is to price energy correctly so that consumers are incentivised to use electricity efficiently and avoid wasteful consumption.

The Government recognises that there are households which may face difficulties coping with the rising cost of utilities, and is ready to help them. In this regard, the Government assists HDB households with their utilities bills payment through the Utilities-Save (U-Save) scheme, with higher amounts of rebates going to lower-income households."

24	Market Development & Systems Charge	How will MDSC-funded initiatives benefit consumers?	"The Market Development and Systems Charge (MDSC) will support a range of market development initiatives, such as the Electricity Futures Market and the Open Electricity Market. These initiatives will benefit consumers by bringing about competitive pricing and more choices.

For instance, the [Open Electricity Market](http://www.openelectricitymarket.sg) allows consumers to buy electricity from a retailer of their choice, at a price plan that best meets their needs. Empowering consumers with this choice and flexibility in their electricity purchases have incentivised retailers to provide more competitive pricing and innovative offers. There are retailers who offer various types of price plans ranging from green energy options to those with tie-ups with other service providers such as telecommunications companies, insurance companies and banks.

The introduction of the Electricity Futures Market has facilitated the entry of several independent retailers and further injected competition in the retail electricity market to the benefit of consumers."
