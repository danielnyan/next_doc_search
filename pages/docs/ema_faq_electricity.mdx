## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/what-is-the-open-electricity-market)

What is the Open Electricity Market?
In the Open Electricity Market, consumers will be able to buy electricity from retailers of their choice at price plans that best meet their needs. Those who prefer to stay with SP Group to buy electricity at the regulated tariff can continue to do so. Switching to a retailer is not compulsory, and there is no deadline to switch to a retailer.
Consumers can use the Price Comparison Tool on the Open Electricity Market website to compare the standard price plans offered by retailers. You can also look at the retailer ratings which are based on the feedback gathered from EMA's Consumer Satisfaction Surveys.
There are two types of standard price plans:

Fixed Price Plans are more suitable for consumers who prefer a constant electricity rate throughout the contract duration. The electricity rate may be higher or lower than the regulated tariff during the contract duration, as the regulated tariff is reviewed every quarter.
Discount Off the Regulated Tariff Plans provide a fixed discount off the regulated tariff, but the electricity rates will change in tandem with the regulated tariff. These plans are more suitable for consumers who do not mind changes in electricity rates every quarter so long as it is lower than the regulated tariff.



## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/will-my-electricity-supply-be-affected-if-i-switch-to-an-electricity-retailer)

Will my electricity supply be affected if I switch to an electricity retailer?
Your electricity supply stays the same whether you switch to a retailer or not. This is because SP Group will continue to operate the national power grid and deliver electricity to everyone.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/will-i-still-be-eligible-for-u-save-if-i-switch-to-an-electricity-retailer)

Will I still be eligible for U-Save if I switch to an electricity retailer?
The Government assists HDB households with their utilities bills payment through the Utilities-Save (U-Save) scheme, with higher amounts of rebates going to lower-income households.
You will continue to be eligible for U-Save rebates, no matter which electricity retailer you switch to. Do note that your U-Save rebates will first be used to offset your non-electricity charges (water, gas and/or refuse collection) before they are used for electricity charges. 
Please refer to the Open Electricity Market website for more details on U-Save. To understand more on the U-save announced at the recent Budget, refer to the GST Voucher website.

Are there plans to nationalise the electricity market?
The Open Electricity Market is about providing consumers with more choices and flexibility when buying electricity. Consumers who have switched continue to enjoy electricity rates lower than the regulated tariff. They have also enjoyed innovative offers from retailers. There is no basis for EMA to reverse this initiative.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/are-electricity-prices-in-singapore-subsidised)

Are electricity prices in Singapore subsidised?
In Singapore, the price of electricity is not subsidised. This is to price energy correctly so that consumers are incentivised to use electricity efficiently and avoid wasteful consumption. 
The Government recognises that there are households which may face difficulties coping with the rising cost of utilities and is ready to help them. In this regard, the Government assists HDB households with their utilities bills payment through the Utilities-Save (U-Save) scheme, with higher amounts of rebates going to lower-income households.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/what-is-the-electricity-tariff)

What is the electricity tariff?
The electricity tariff is the price at which consumers buy electricity from SP Group. It is reviewed every quarter and is regulated by EMA to reflect the actual cost of electricity. 
For more information on the latest tariff breakdown for the different tension levels, visit the SP Group  website.
With Open Electricity Market, consumers who have switched to buying electricity from a retailer of their choice can enjoy discounts off the regulated tariff. Visit the Open Electricity Market website for more information on your electricity purchase options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-is-the-electricity-tariff-determined)

How is the electricity tariff determined?
There are two key components of the electricity tariff - fuel cost and non-fuel cost. The fuel cost component for each quarter is calculated using the average of daily natural gas prices in the first two-and-a-half month period in the preceding quarter. 
The non-fuel cost component reflects the cost of generating and delivering electricity to homes. It comprises mainly the grid charge, and the capital and operating costs of generation companies. There is a time lag in the gas price reflected in the electricity tariff because changes in gas prices in the current quarter will only be taken into account in the next quarter's tariff. 
This means that any increase or decrease in gas prices in the current quarter will only be reflected in the next quarter’s tariff. Refer here for more information.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/why-cant-large-consumers-buy-electricity-at-the-regulated-tariff-from-sp-group)

Why can't large consumers buy electricity at the regulated tariff from SP Group?
Electricity offered through the regulated tariff is purchased by SP through existing vesting contracts with gencos. There is a limited quantity of such electricity and we have reserved them for households and small business consumers, who traditionally do not have the bargaining power to negotiate for better retail prices.
Allowing large consumers to switch to the regulated tariff means that SP Group will need to contract for additional supply with gencos at higher prices, and/or buy additional supply of electricity from the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market at the prevailing Uniform Singapore Energy Price, which will cause the regulated tariff to rise.
Households and small consumers would have to bear the costs of price stability for large consumers. Instead, EMA has been engaging generation companies (gencos) to try to plug the shortfall in retail contracts as well as work with the gencos to engage companies when these additional retail contracts become available.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-am-i-billed-for-my-electricity-consumption)

How am I billed for my electricity consumption?
Your electricity consumption is based on the readings on your electricity meters which are read bi-monthly by SP Group. 
For months when your meters are not read, your electricity usage will be estimated based on past consumption.  Any over- or under-estimation of the readings will be adjusted in subsequent bills when the actual meter reading is taken.  
You can submit meter readings via these channels:

The SP App
Call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000. Please press 4 after selecting the language options to submit your meter reading. 

Note that if your meter reading is due on a weekend or public holiday, please use the SP App or call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000 to submit it instead.

If your retailer bills you directly, your meter reading can also be submitted through the e-Services portal. Sign up for an e-Services account now to start doing so.
If you are still receiving your electricity bill from SP Group, submit your meter reading via the SP Utilities Portal.

The regulated tariff is for household and small business consumers with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh only.
For large businesses with an average monthly consumption of at least 4MWh, your account will be automatically transferred to SP Group at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer. You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits your business needs before the transfer. You can choose to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should be aware that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is representative of the current energy climate.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/consumer-safeguards/why-do-some-retailers-choose-to-exit-the-retail-electricity-market)

Why do some retailers choose to exit the retail electricity market?
In an open and liberalised electricity market, retailers may exit the market or the consolidation of players could occur due to market competition. The global energy crunch in late 2021 resulted in high and volatile wholesale electricity prices in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market, which spilled over to the electricity retail market. As a result, independent retailers were affected, which led to some of them exiting the market or prematurely terminated consumer contracts.
Below is the default arrangement for consumers whose retailers have decided to exit the market:

Households and small businesses with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh that are transferred to SP Group will buy electricity at the regulated tariff.
Large businesses with an average monthly consumption above 4MWh will be automatically transferred to SP Group to buy electricity at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer.

You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits their needs before the transfer and are able to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should take note that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is dependent on the prevailing market conditions.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/what-is-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker-rccb-and-where-is-it-located-in-my-home)

What is a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) and where is it located in my home?
The Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) or commonly known as the circuit breaker is an electrical safety device that cuts off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock. Current leakages can be caused by factors such as ageing or exposed wires, faulty electrical appliances, and damaged insulation.
The RCCB is usually located in the distribution board (also known as DB box) or circuit breaker box in your home. It can be identified as a switch with a ‘Test’ button. For HDB residents who are unable to locate your RCCB, please contact your Branch Service Line at 1800-225-5432.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/is-it-compulsory-to-install-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker-rccb-in-my-home)

Is it compulsory to install a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) in my home?
Yes, if you do not already have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) installed in your home. To enhance electrical safety in all households, all residential premises without a circuit breaker will be required to install an RCCB.
All homeowners will be given a grace period of two years, till 1 July 2025 to do so. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/i-have-an-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-in-my-home--do-i-need-to-change-it-to-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker)

I have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) in my home. Do I need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB)?
If you have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) installed in your home, you do not need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB). Both the ELCB and RCCB are electrical safety devices that cut off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock.
Homeowners with RCCBs or ELCBs are advised to test that their circuit breaker is in working condition using a 3-step test. This is to ensure that the circuit breaker is functional and protects all electrical circuits in the home.
If the circuit breaker is not working, homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to replace the circuit breaker. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/how-do-i-test-whether-my-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-or-residual-current-circuit-breaker-is-working)

How do I test whether my Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working?
You can perform the following 3-step test to ensure your Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working and protects all electrical circuits in your home.

Test the ELCB or RCCB by pressing the ‘Test’ button. The ELCB or RCCB switch will flip down and cut off all power supply in your home. If the ELCB or RCCB switch does not flip down, it is faulty. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Test all light switches and power sockets in every room. The ELCB or RCCB is working if lights and power sockets do not turn on when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down. If any light or power socket continues to work when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down, the house is not fully protected by the circuit breaker. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Flip up ELCB or RCCB switch to restore power supply. Switch on lights and appliances that you need.

For a detailed step-by-step guide, please visit our RCCB Safety. You are advised to test your ELCB or RCCB once a month to check that it is in good working condition.
All homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to install an RCCB if necessary. It is recommended to contact a few LEWs to perform price comparisons before engaging one. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-are-advanced-electricity-meters)

What are advanced electricity meters?
Advanced electricity meters, also known as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) meters, are digital meters which allow electricity consumption to be registered at half-hourly intervals. To empower households to use electricity more efficiently, advanced electricity meters will be installed across Singapore by 2024. Visit this page to find out more about the metering options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-is-the-difference-between-a-cumulative-and-an-advanced-electricity-meter)

What is the difference between a cumulative and an advanced electricity meter?
Most residential premises today use cumulative meters to measure electricity consumption. Cumulative meters are read once every two months when SP Group sends a meter reader to your premises to record your electricity usage. On the month when your meter is not read, SP Group will estimate the month's consumption based on the methodology approved by EMA.
Advanced electricity meters allow electricity consumption to be measured at half-hourly intervals and you can track your consumption via the SP app. With these meters, you will also have the option* to be billed based on your actual consumption, instead of estimated consumption, on alternate months.
*Not applicable to households that continue to buy electricity at the regulated tariff rate.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/are-there-any-costs-involved-for-the-meter-replacement)

Are there any costs involved for the meter replacement?
Advanced electricity meter costs are recovered as part of providing grid infrastructure services, which are part of electricity rates charged to households. There are no other separate costs involved.
With access to their electricity consumption via the SP Utilities mobile app, households can take steps to manage their usage more efficiently and enjoy savings as a result.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/what-is-the-open-electricity-market)

What is the Open Electricity Market?
In the Open Electricity Market, consumers will be able to buy electricity from retailers of their choice at price plans that best meet their needs. Those who prefer to stay with SP Group to buy electricity at the regulated tariff can continue to do so. Switching to a retailer is not compulsory, and there is no deadline to switch to a retailer.
Consumers can use the Price Comparison Tool on the Open Electricity Market website to compare the standard price plans offered by retailers. You can also look at the retailer ratings which are based on the feedback gathered from EMA's Consumer Satisfaction Surveys.
There are two types of standard price plans:

Fixed Price Plans are more suitable for consumers who prefer a constant electricity rate throughout the contract duration. The electricity rate may be higher or lower than the regulated tariff during the contract duration, as the regulated tariff is reviewed every quarter.
Discount Off the Regulated Tariff Plans provide a fixed discount off the regulated tariff, but the electricity rates will change in tandem with the regulated tariff. These plans are more suitable for consumers who do not mind changes in electricity rates every quarter so long as it is lower than the regulated tariff.



## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/will-my-electricity-supply-be-affected-if-i-switch-to-an-electricity-retailer)

Consumers who have switched continue to enjoy electricity rates lower than the regulated tariff. They have also enjoyed innovative offers from retailers. There is no basis for EMA to reverse this initiative.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/are-electricity-prices-in-singapore-subsidised)

Are electricity prices in Singapore subsidised?
In Singapore, the price of electricity is not subsidised. This is to price energy correctly so that consumers are incentivised to use electricity efficiently and avoid wasteful consumption. 
The Government recognises that there are households which may face difficulties coping with the rising cost of utilities and is ready to help them. In this regard, the Government assists HDB households with their utilities bills payment through the Utilities-Save (U-Save) scheme, with higher amounts of rebates going to lower-income households.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/what-is-the-electricity-tariff)

What is the electricity tariff?
The electricity tariff is the price at which consumers buy electricity from SP Group. It is reviewed every quarter and is regulated by EMA to reflect the actual cost of electricity. 
For more information on the latest tariff breakdown for the different tension levels, visit the SP Group  website.
With Open Electricity Market, consumers who have switched to buying electricity from a retailer of their choice can enjoy discounts off the regulated tariff. Visit the Open Electricity Market website for more information on your electricity purchase options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-is-the-electricity-tariff-determined)

How is the electricity tariff determined?
There are two key components of the electricity tariff - fuel cost and non-fuel cost. The fuel cost component for each quarter is calculated using the average of daily natural gas prices in the first two-and-a-half month period in the preceding quarter. 
The non-fuel cost component reflects the cost of generating and delivering electricity to homes. It comprises mainly the grid charge, and the capital and operating costs of generation companies. There is a time lag in the gas price reflected in the electricity tariff because changes in gas prices in the current quarter will only be taken into account in the next quarter's tariff. 
This means that any increase or decrease in gas prices in the current quarter will only be reflected in the next quarter’s tariff. Refer here for more information.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/why-cant-large-consumers-buy-electricity-at-the-regulated-tariff-from-sp-group)

Why can't large consumers buy electricity at the regulated tariff from SP Group?
Electricity offered through the regulated tariff is purchased by SP through existing vesting contracts with gencos. There is a limited quantity of such electricity and we have reserved them for households and small business consumers, who traditionally do not have the bargaining power to negotiate for better retail prices.
Allowing large consumers to switch to the regulated tariff means that SP Group will need to contract for additional supply with gencos at higher prices, and/or buy additional supply of electricity from the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market at the prevailing Uniform Singapore Energy Price, which will cause the regulated tariff to rise.
Households and small consumers would have to bear the costs of price stability for large consumers. Instead, EMA has been engaging generation companies (gencos) to try to plug the shortfall in retail contracts as well as work with the gencos to engage companies when these additional retail contracts become available.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-am-i-billed-for-my-electricity-consumption)

How am I billed for my electricity consumption?
Your electricity consumption is based on the readings on your electricity meters which are read bi-monthly by SP Group. 
For months when your meters are not read, your electricity usage will be estimated based on past consumption.  Any over- or under-estimation of the readings will be adjusted in subsequent bills when the actual meter reading is taken.  
You can submit meter readings via these channels:

The SP App
Call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000. Please press 4 after selecting the language options to submit your meter reading. 

Note that if your meter reading is due on a weekend or public holiday, please use the SP App or call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000 to submit it instead.

If your retailer bills you directly, your meter reading can also be submitted through the e-Services portal. Sign up for an e-Services account now to start doing so.
If you are still receiving your electricity bill from SP Group, submit your meter reading via the SP Utilities Portal.

What is Uniform Singapore Energy Price (USEP) and how is it determined? Does EMA regulate the USEP?
The Uniform Singapore Energy Price (USEP) refers to the half-hourly energy price in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market (SWEM). EMA does not regulate the USEP, as it is based on the half-hourly market clearing price which reflects the prevailing demand and supply conditions. Electricity demand and supply, in turn, are affected by various factors.

Why do some retailers choose to exit the retail electricity market?
In an open and liberalised electricity market, retailers may exit the market or the consolidation of players could occur due to market competition. The global energy crunch in late 2021 resulted in high and volatile wholesale electricity prices in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market, which spilled over to the electricity retail market. As a result, independent retailers were affected, which led to some of them exiting the market or prematurely terminated consumer contracts.
Below is the default arrangement for consumers whose retailers have decided to exit the market:

Households and small businesses with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh that are transferred to SP Group will buy electricity at the regulated tariff.
Large businesses with an average monthly consumption above 4MWh will be automatically transferred to SP Group to buy electricity at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer.

You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits their needs before the transfer and are able to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should take note that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is dependent on the prevailing market conditions.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/what-is-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker-rccb-and-where-is-it-located-in-my-home)

What is a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) and where is it located in my home?
The Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) or commonly known as the circuit breaker is an electrical safety device that cuts off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock. Current leakages can be caused by factors such as ageing or exposed wires, faulty electrical appliances, and damaged insulation.
The RCCB is usually located in the distribution board (also known as DB box) or circuit breaker box in your home. It can be identified as a switch with a ‘Test’ button. For HDB residents who are unable to locate your RCCB, please contact your Branch Service Line at 1800-225-5432.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/is-it-compulsory-to-install-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker-rccb-in-my-home)

Is it compulsory to install a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) in my home?
Yes, if you do not already have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) installed in your home. To enhance electrical safety in all households, all residential premises without a circuit breaker will be required to install an RCCB.
All homeowners will be given a grace period of two years, till 1 July 2025 to do so. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.

I have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) in my home. Do I need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB)?
If you have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) installed in your home, you do not need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB). Both the ELCB and RCCB are electrical safety devices that cut off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock.
Homeowners with RCCBs or ELCBs are advised to test that their circuit breaker is in working condition using a 3-step test. This is to ensure that the circuit breaker is functional and protects all electrical circuits in the home.
If the circuit breaker is not working, homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to replace the circuit breaker. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/how-do-i-test-whether-my-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-or-residual-current-circuit-breaker-is-working)

How do I test whether my Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working?
You can perform the following 3-step test to ensure your Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working and protects all electrical circuits in your home.

Test the ELCB or RCCB by pressing the ‘Test’ button. The ELCB or RCCB switch will flip down and cut off all power supply in your home. If the ELCB or RCCB switch does not flip down, it is faulty. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Test all light switches and power sockets in every room. The ELCB or RCCB is working if lights and power sockets do not turn on when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down. If any light or power socket continues to work when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down, the house is not fully protected by the circuit breaker. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Flip up ELCB or RCCB switch to restore power supply. Switch on lights and appliances that you need.

For a detailed step-by-step guide, please visit our RCCB Safety. You are advised to test your ELCB or RCCB once a month to check that it is in good working condition.
All homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to install an RCCB if necessary. It is recommended to contact a few LEWs to perform price comparisons before engaging one.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-are-advanced-electricity-meters)

What are advanced electricity meters?
Advanced electricity meters, also known as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) meters, are digital meters which allow electricity consumption to be registered at half-hourly intervals. To empower households to use electricity more efficiently, advanced electricity meters will be installed across Singapore by 2024. Visit this page to find out more about the metering options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-is-the-difference-between-a-cumulative-and-an-advanced-electricity-meter)

What is the difference between a cumulative and an advanced electricity meter?
Most residential premises today use cumulative meters to measure electricity consumption. Cumulative meters are read once every two months when SP Group sends a meter reader to your premises to record your electricity usage. On the month when your meter is not read, SP Group will estimate the month's consumption based on the methodology approved by EMA.
Advanced electricity meters allow electricity consumption to be measured at half-hourly intervals and you can track your consumption via the SP app. With these meters, you will also have the option* to be billed based on your actual consumption, instead of estimated consumption, on alternate months.
*Not applicable to households that continue to buy electricity at the regulated tariff rate.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/what-is-the-open-electricity-market)

What is the Open Electricity Market?
In the Open Electricity Market, consumers will be able to buy electricity from retailers of their choice at price plans that best meet their needs. Those who prefer to stay with SP Group to buy electricity at the regulated tariff can continue to do so. Switching to a retailer is not compulsory, and there is no deadline to switch to a retailer.
Consumers can use the Price Comparison Tool on the Open Electricity Market website to compare the standard price plans offered by retailers. You can also look at the retailer ratings which are based on the feedback gathered from EMA's Consumer Satisfaction Surveys.
There are two types of standard price plans:

Fixed Price Plans are more suitable for consumers who prefer a constant electricity rate throughout the contract duration. The electricity rate may be higher or lower than the regulated tariff during the contract duration, as the regulated tariff is reviewed every quarter.
Discount Off the Regulated Tariff Plans provide a fixed discount off the regulated tariff, but the electricity rates will change in tandem with the regulated tariff. These plans are more suitable for consumers who do not mind changes in electricity rates every quarter so long as it is lower than the regulated tariff.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/what-is-the-electricity-tariff)

What is the electricity tariff?
The electricity tariff is the price at which consumers buy electricity from SP Group. It is reviewed every quarter and is regulated by EMA to reflect the actual cost of electricity. 
For more information on the latest tariff breakdown for the different tension levels, visit the SP Group  website.
With Open Electricity Market, consumers who have switched to buying electricity from a retailer of their choice can enjoy discounts off the regulated tariff. Visit the Open Electricity Market website for more information on your electricity purchase options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-is-the-electricity-tariff-determined)

How is the electricity tariff determined?
There are two key components of the electricity tariff - fuel cost and non-fuel cost. The fuel cost component for each quarter is calculated using the average of daily natural gas prices in the first two-and-a-half month period in the preceding quarter. 
The non-fuel cost component reflects the cost of generating and delivering electricity to homes. It comprises mainly the grid charge, and the capital and operating costs of generation companies. There is a time lag in the gas price reflected in the electricity tariff because changes in gas prices in the current quarter will only be taken into account in the next quarter's tariff. 
This means that any increase or decrease in gas prices in the current quarter will only be reflected in the next quarter’s tariff. Refer here for more information.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/why-cant-large-consumers-buy-electricity-at-the-regulated-tariff-from-sp-group)

Why can't large consumers buy electricity at the regulated tariff from SP Group?
Electricity offered through the regulated tariff is purchased by SP through existing vesting contracts with gencos. There is a limited quantity of such electricity and we have reserved them for households and small business consumers, who traditionally do not have the bargaining power to negotiate for better retail prices.
Allowing large consumers to switch to the regulated tariff means that SP Group will need to contract for additional supply with gencos at higher prices, and/or buy additional supply of electricity from the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market at the prevailing Uniform Singapore Energy Price, which will cause the regulated tariff to rise.
Households and small consumers would have to bear the costs of price stability for large consumers. Instead, EMA has been engaging generation companies (gencos) to try to plug the shortfall in retail contracts as well as work with the gencos to engage companies when these additional retail contracts become available.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-am-i-billed-for-my-electricity-consumption)

How am I billed for my electricity consumption?
Your electricity consumption is based on the readings on your electricity meters which are read bi-monthly by SP Group. 
For months when your meters are not read, your electricity usage will be estimated based on past consumption.  Any over- or under-estimation of the readings will be adjusted in subsequent bills when the actual meter reading is taken.  
You can submit meter readings via these channels:

The SP App
Call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000. Please press 4 after selecting the language options to submit your meter reading. 

Note that if your meter reading is due on a weekend or public holiday, please use the SP App or call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000 to submit it instead.

If your retailer bills you directly, your meter reading can also be submitted through the e-Services portal. Sign up for an e-Services account now to start doing so.
If you are still receiving your electricity bill from SP Group, submit your meter reading via the SP Utilities Portal.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/consumer-safeguards/why-do-some-retailers-choose-to-exit-the-retail-electricity-market)

Why do some retailers choose to exit the retail electricity market?
In an open and liberalised electricity market, retailers may exit the market or the consolidation of players could occur due to market competition. The global energy crunch in late 2021 resulted in high and volatile wholesale electricity prices in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market, which spilled over to the electricity retail market. As a result, independent retailers were affected, which led to some of them exiting the market or prematurely terminated consumer contracts.
Below is the default arrangement for consumers whose retailers have decided to exit the market:

Households and small businesses with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh that are transferred to SP Group will buy electricity at the regulated tariff.
Large businesses with an average monthly consumption above 4MWh will be automatically transferred to SP Group to buy electricity at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer.

You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits their needs before the transfer and are able to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should take note that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is dependent on the prevailing market conditions.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/what-is-the-open-electricity-market)

What is the Open Electricity Market?
In the Open Electricity Market, consumers will be able to buy electricity from retailers of their choice at price plans that best meet their needs. Those who prefer to stay with SP Group to buy electricity at the regulated tariff can continue to do so. Switching to a retailer is not compulsory, and there is no deadline to switch to a retailer.
Consumers can use the Price Comparison Tool on the Open Electricity Market website to compare the standard price plans offered by retailers. You can also look at the retailer ratings which are based on the feedback gathered from EMA's Consumer Satisfaction Surveys.
There are two types of standard price plans:

Fixed Price Plans are more suitable for consumers who prefer a constant electricity rate throughout the contract duration. The electricity rate may be higher or lower than the regulated tariff during the contract duration, as the regulated tariff is reviewed every quarter.
Discount Off the Regulated Tariff Plans provide a fixed discount off the regulated tariff, but the electricity rates will change in tandem with the regulated tariff. These plans are more suitable for consumers who do not mind changes in electricity rates every quarter so long as it is lower than the regulated tariff.



## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/will-my-electricity-supply-be-affected-if-i-switch-to-an-electricity-retailer)

Will there be more stringent measures to assess retailers who are keen to enter the retail electricity market?
There are licensing criteria and consumer safeguards in place. EMA has been and will continue to refine the requirements for retailers to safeguard consumers' interests.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/are-there-plans-to-nationalise-the-electricity-market)

Are there plans to nationalise the electricity market?
The Open Electricity Market is about providing consumers with more choices and flexibility when buying electricity. Consumers who have switched continue to enjoy electricity rates lower than the regulated tariff. They have also enjoyed innovative offers from retailers. There is no basis for EMA to reverse this initiative.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/are-electricity-prices-in-singapore-subsidised)

Are electricity prices in Singapore subsidised?
In Singapore, the price of electricity is not subsidised. This is to price energy correctly so that consumers are incentivised to use electricity efficiently and avoid wasteful consumption. 
The Government recognises that there are households which may face difficulties coping with the rising cost of utilities and is ready to help them. In this regard, the Government assists HDB households with their utilities bills payment through the Utilities-Save (U-Save) scheme, with higher amounts of rebates going to lower-income households.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/what-is-the-electricity-tariff)

What is the electricity tariff?
The electricity tariff is the price at which consumers buy electricity from SP Group. It is reviewed every quarter and is regulated by EMA to reflect the actual cost of electricity. 
For more information on the latest tariff breakdown for the different tension levels, visit the SP Group  website.
With Open Electricity Market, consumers who have switched to buying electricity from a retailer of their choice can enjoy discounts off the regulated tariff. Visit the Open Electricity Market website for more information on your electricity purchase options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-is-the-electricity-tariff-determined)

How is the electricity tariff determined?
There are two key components of the electricity tariff - fuel cost and non-fuel cost. The fuel cost component for each quarter is calculated using the average of daily natural gas prices in the first two-and-a-half month period in the preceding quarter. 
The non-fuel cost component reflects the cost of generating and delivering electricity to homes. It comprises mainly the grid charge, and the capital and operating costs of generation companies. There is a time lag in the gas price reflected in the electricity tariff because changes in gas prices in the current quarter will only be taken into account in the next quarter's tariff. 
This means that any increase or decrease in gas prices in the current quarter will only be reflected in the next quarter’s tariff. Refer here for more information.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/why-cant-large-consumers-buy-electricity-at-the-regulated-tariff-from-sp-group)

Why can't large consumers buy electricity at the regulated tariff from SP Group?
Electricity offered through the regulated tariff is purchased by SP through existing vesting contracts with gencos. There is a limited quantity of such electricity and we have reserved them for households and small business consumers, who traditionally do not have the bargaining power to negotiate for better retail prices.
Allowing large consumers to switch to the regulated tariff means that SP Group will need to contract for additional supply with gencos at higher prices, and/or buy additional supply of electricity from the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market at the prevailing Uniform Singapore Energy Price, which will cause the regulated tariff to rise.
Households and small consumers would have to bear the costs of price stability for large consumers. Instead, EMA has been engaging generation companies (gencos) to try to plug the shortfall in retail contracts as well as work with the gencos to engage companies when these additional retail contracts become available.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-am-i-billed-for-my-electricity-consumption)

How am I billed for my electricity consumption?
Your electricity consumption is based on the readings on your electricity meters which are read bi-monthly by SP Group. 
For months when your meters are not read, your electricity usage will be estimated based on past consumption.  Any over- or under-estimation of the readings will be adjusted in subsequent bills when the actual meter reading is taken.  
You can submit meter readings via these channels:

The SP App
Call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000. Please press 4 after selecting the language options to submit your meter reading. 

Note that if your meter reading is due on a weekend or public holiday, please use the SP App or call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000 to submit it instead.

If your retailer bills you directly, your meter reading can also be submitted through the e-Services portal. Sign up for an e-Services account now to start doing so.
If you are still receiving your electricity bill from SP Group, submit your meter reading via the SP Utilities Portal.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/consumer-safeguards/why-do-some-retailers-choose-to-exit-the-retail-electricity-market)

Why do some retailers choose to exit the retail electricity market?
In an open and liberalised electricity market, retailers may exit the market or the consolidation of players could occur due to market competition. The global energy crunch in late 2021 resulted in high and volatile wholesale electricity prices in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market, which spilled over to the electricity retail market. As a result, independent retailers were affected, which led to some of them exiting the market or prematurely terminated consumer contracts.
Below is the default arrangement for consumers whose retailers have decided to exit the market:

Households and small businesses with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh that are transferred to SP Group will buy electricity at the regulated tariff.
Large businesses with an average monthly consumption above 4MWh will be automatically transferred to SP Group to buy electricity at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer.

You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits their needs before the transfer and are able to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should take note that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is dependent on the prevailing market conditions.

I have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) in my home. Do I need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB)?
If you have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) installed in your home, you do not need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB). Both the ELCB and RCCB are electrical safety devices that cut off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock.
Homeowners with RCCBs or ELCBs are advised to test that their circuit breaker is in working condition using a 3-step test. This is to ensure that the circuit breaker is functional and protects all electrical circuits in the home.
If the circuit breaker is not working, homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to replace the circuit breaker. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/how-do-i-test-whether-my-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-or-residual-current-circuit-breaker-is-working)

How do I test whether my Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working?
You can perform the following 3-step test to ensure your Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working and protects all electrical circuits in your home.

Test the ELCB or RCCB by pressing the ‘Test’ button. The ELCB or RCCB switch will flip down and cut off all power supply in your home. If the ELCB or RCCB switch does not flip down, it is faulty. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Test all light switches and power sockets in every room. The ELCB or RCCB is working if lights and power sockets do not turn on when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down. If any light or power socket continues to work when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down, the house is not fully protected by the circuit breaker. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Flip up ELCB or RCCB switch to restore power supply. Switch on lights and appliances that you need.

For a detailed step-by-step guide, please visit our RCCB Safety. You are advised to test your ELCB or RCCB once a month to check that it is in good working condition.
All homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to install an RCCB if necessary. It is recommended to contact a few LEWs to perform price comparisons before engaging one. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-are-advanced-electricity-meters)

What are advanced electricity meters?
Advanced electricity meters, also known as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) meters, are digital meters which allow electricity consumption to be registered at half-hourly intervals. To empower households to use electricity more efficiently, advanced electricity meters will be installed across Singapore by 2024. Visit this page to find out more about the metering options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-is-the-difference-between-a-cumulative-and-an-advanced-electricity-meter)

What is the difference between a cumulative and an advanced electricity meter?
Most residential premises today use cumulative meters to measure electricity consumption. Cumulative meters are read once every two months when SP Group sends a meter reader to your premises to record your electricity usage. On the month when your meter is not read, SP Group will estimate the month's consumption based on the methodology approved by EMA.
Advanced electricity meters allow electricity consumption to be measured at half-hourly intervals and you can track your consumption via the SP app. With these meters, you will also have the option* to be billed based on your actual consumption, instead of estimated consumption, on alternate months.
*Not applicable to households that continue to buy electricity at the regulated tariff rate.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/are-there-any-costs-involved-for-the-meter-replacement)

Are there any costs involved for the meter replacement?
Advanced electricity meter costs are recovered as part of providing grid infrastructure services, which are part of electricity rates charged to households. There are no other separate costs involved.
With access to their electricity consumption via the SP Utilities mobile app, households can take steps to manage their usage more efficiently and enjoy savings as a result.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/what-is-the-open-electricity-market)

What is the Open Electricity Market?
In the Open Electricity Market, consumers will be able to buy electricity from retailers of their choice at price plans that best meet their needs. Those who prefer to stay with SP Group to buy electricity at the regulated tariff can continue to do so. Switching to a retailer is not compulsory, and there is no deadline to switch to a retailer.
Consumers can use the Price Comparison Tool on the Open Electricity Market website to compare the standard price plans offered by retailers. You can also look at the retailer ratings which are based on the feedback gathered from EMA's Consumer Satisfaction Surveys.
There are two types of standard price plans:

Fixed Price Plans are more suitable for consumers who prefer a constant electricity rate throughout the contract duration. The electricity rate may be higher or lower than the regulated tariff during the contract duration, as the regulated tariff is reviewed every quarter.
Discount Off the Regulated Tariff Plans provide a fixed discount off the regulated tariff, but the electricity rates will change in tandem with the regulated tariff. These plans are more suitable for consumers who do not mind changes in electricity rates every quarter so long as it is lower than the regulated tariff.



## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/will-my-electricity-supply-be-affected-if-i-switch-to-an-electricity-retailer)

Are there plans to nationalise the electricity market?
The Open Electricity Market is about providing consumers with more choices and flexibility when buying electricity. Consumers who have switched continue to enjoy electricity rates lower than the regulated tariff. They have also enjoyed innovative offers from retailers. There is no basis for EMA to reverse this initiative.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/are-electricity-prices-in-singapore-subsidised)

Are electricity prices in Singapore subsidised?
In Singapore, the price of electricity is not subsidised. This is to price energy correctly so that consumers are incentivised to use electricity efficiently and avoid wasteful consumption. 
The Government recognises that there are households which may face difficulties coping with the rising cost of utilities and is ready to help them. In this regard, the Government assists HDB households with their utilities bills payment through the Utilities-Save (U-Save) scheme, with higher amounts of rebates going to lower-income households.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/what-is-the-electricity-tariff)

What is the electricity tariff?
The electricity tariff is the price at which consumers buy electricity from SP Group. It is reviewed every quarter and is regulated by EMA to reflect the actual cost of electricity. 
For more information on the latest tariff breakdown for the different tension levels, visit the SP Group  website.
With Open Electricity Market, consumers who have switched to buying electricity from a retailer of their choice can enjoy discounts off the regulated tariff. Visit the Open Electricity Market website for more information on your electricity purchase options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-is-the-electricity-tariff-determined)

How is the electricity tariff determined?
There are two key components of the electricity tariff - fuel cost and non-fuel cost. The fuel cost component for each quarter is calculated using the average of daily natural gas prices in the first two-and-a-half month period in the preceding quarter. 
The non-fuel cost component reflects the cost of generating and delivering electricity to homes. It comprises mainly the grid charge, and the capital and operating costs of generation companies. There is a time lag in the gas price reflected in the electricity tariff because changes in gas prices in the current quarter will only be taken into account in the next quarter's tariff. 
This means that any increase or decrease in gas prices in the current quarter will only be reflected in the next quarter’s tariff. Refer here for more information.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/why-cant-large-consumers-buy-electricity-at-the-regulated-tariff-from-sp-group)

Why can't large consumers buy electricity at the regulated tariff from SP Group?
Electricity offered through the regulated tariff is purchased by SP through existing vesting contracts with gencos. There is a limited quantity of such electricity and we have reserved them for households and small business consumers, who traditionally do not have the bargaining power to negotiate for better retail prices.
Allowing large consumers to switch to the regulated tariff means that SP Group will need to contract for additional supply with gencos at higher prices, and/or buy additional supply of electricity from the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market at the prevailing Uniform Singapore Energy Price, which will cause the regulated tariff to rise.
Households and small consumers would have to bear the costs of price stability for large consumers. Instead, EMA has been engaging generation companies (gencos) to try to plug the shortfall in retail contracts as well as work with the gencos to engage companies when these additional retail contracts become available.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-am-i-billed-for-my-electricity-consumption)

How am I billed for my electricity consumption?
Your electricity consumption is based on the readings on your electricity meters which are read bi-monthly by SP Group. 
For months when your meters are not read, your electricity usage will be estimated based on past consumption.  Any over- or under-estimation of the readings will be adjusted in subsequent bills when the actual meter reading is taken.  
You can submit meter readings via these channels:

The SP App
Call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000. Please press 4 after selecting the language options to submit your meter reading. 

Note that if your meter reading is due on a weekend or public holiday, please use the SP App or call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000 to submit it instead.

If your retailer bills you directly, your meter reading can also be submitted through the e-Services portal. Sign up for an e-Services account now to start doing so.
If you are still receiving your electricity bill from SP Group, submit your meter reading via the SP Utilities Portal.

What is Uniform Singapore Energy Price (USEP) and how is it determined? Does EMA regulate the USEP?
The Uniform Singapore Energy Price (USEP) refers to the half-hourly energy price in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market (SWEM). EMA does not regulate the USEP, as it is based on the half-hourly market clearing price which reflects the prevailing demand and supply conditions. Electricity demand and supply, in turn, are affected by various factors.

I am a large business consumer. With the exit of my retailer, can I choose to buy electricity from SP Group at the regulated tariff?
The regulated tariff is for household and small business consumers with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh only.
For large businesses with an average monthly consumption of at least 4MWh, your account will be automatically transferred to SP Group at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer. You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits your business needs before the transfer. You can choose to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should be aware that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is representative of the current energy climate.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/consumer-safeguards/why-do-some-retailers-choose-to-exit-the-retail-electricity-market)

Why do some retailers choose to exit the retail electricity market?
In an open and liberalised electricity market, retailers may exit the market or the consolidation of players could occur due to market competition. The global energy crunch in late 2021 resulted in high and volatile wholesale electricity prices in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market, which spilled over to the electricity retail market. As a result, independent retailers were affected, which led to some of them exiting the market or prematurely terminated consumer contracts.
Below is the default arrangement for consumers whose retailers have decided to exit the market:

Households and small businesses with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh that are transferred to SP Group will buy electricity at the regulated tariff.
Large businesses with an average monthly consumption above 4MWh will be automatically transferred to SP Group to buy electricity at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer.

You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits their needs before the transfer and are able to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should take note that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is dependent on the prevailing market conditions.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/what-is-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker-rccb-and-where-is-it-located-in-my-home)

What is a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) and where is it located in my home?
The Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) or commonly known as the circuit breaker is an electrical safety device that cuts off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock. Current leakages can be caused by factors such as ageing or exposed wires, faulty electrical appliances, and damaged insulation.
The RCCB is usually located in the distribution board (also known as DB box) or circuit breaker box in your home. It can be identified as a switch with a ‘Test’ button. For HDB residents who are unable to locate your RCCB, please contact your Branch Service Line at 1800-225-5432.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/is-it-compulsory-to-install-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker-rccb-in-my-home)

Is it compulsory to install a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) in my home?
Yes, if you do not already have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) installed in your home. To enhance electrical safety in all households, all residential premises without a circuit breaker will be required to install an RCCB.
All homeowners will be given a grace period of two years, till 1 July 2025 to do so. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/i-have-an-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-in-my-home--do-i-need-to-change-it-to-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker)

I have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) in my home. Do I need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB)?
If you have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) installed in your home, you do not need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB). Both the ELCB and RCCB are electrical safety devices that cut off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock.
Homeowners with RCCBs or ELCBs are advised to test that their circuit breaker is in working condition using a 3-step test. This is to ensure that the circuit breaker is functional and protects all electrical circuits in the home.
If the circuit breaker is not working, homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to replace the circuit breaker. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/how-do-i-test-whether-my-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-or-residual-current-circuit-breaker-is-working)

How do I test whether my Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working?
You can perform the following 3-step test to ensure your Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working and protects all electrical circuits in your home.

Test the ELCB or RCCB by pressing the ‘Test’ button. The ELCB or RCCB switch will flip down and cut off all power supply in your home. If the ELCB or RCCB switch does not flip down, it is faulty. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Test all light switches and power sockets in every room. The ELCB or RCCB is working if lights and power sockets do not turn on when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down. If any light or power socket continues to work when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down, the house is not fully protected by the circuit breaker. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Flip up ELCB or RCCB switch to restore power supply. Switch on lights and appliances that you need.

For a detailed step-by-step guide, please visit our RCCB Safety. You are advised to test your ELCB or RCCB once a month to check that it is in good working condition.
All homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to install an RCCB if necessary. It is recommended to contact a few LEWs to perform price comparisons before engaging one. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-are-advanced-electricity-meters)

What are advanced electricity meters?
Advanced electricity meters, also known as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) meters, are digital meters which allow electricity consumption to be registered at half-hourly intervals. To empower households to use electricity more efficiently, advanced electricity meters will be installed across Singapore by 2024. Visit this page to find out more about the metering options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-is-the-difference-between-a-cumulative-and-an-advanced-electricity-meter)

What is the difference between a cumulative and an advanced electricity meter?
Most residential premises today use cumulative meters to measure electricity consumption. Cumulative meters are read once every two months when SP Group sends a meter reader to your premises to record your electricity usage. On the month when your meter is not read, SP Group will estimate the month's consumption based on the methodology approved by EMA.
Advanced electricity meters allow electricity consumption to be measured at half-hourly intervals and you can track your consumption via the SP app. With these meters, you will also have the option* to be billed based on your actual consumption, instead of estimated consumption, on alternate months.
*Not applicable to households that continue to buy electricity at the regulated tariff rate.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/what-is-the-open-electricity-market)

What is the Open Electricity Market?
In the Open Electricity Market, consumers will be able to buy electricity from retailers of their choice at price plans that best meet their needs. Those who prefer to stay with SP Group to buy electricity at the regulated tariff can continue to do so. Switching to a retailer is not compulsory, and there is no deadline to switch to a retailer.
Consumers can use the Price Comparison Tool on the Open Electricity Market website to compare the standard price plans offered by retailers. You can also look at the retailer ratings which are based on the feedback gathered from EMA's Consumer Satisfaction Surveys.
There are two types of standard price plans:

Fixed Price Plans are more suitable for consumers who prefer a constant electricity rate throughout the contract duration. The electricity rate may be higher or lower than the regulated tariff during the contract duration, as the regulated tariff is reviewed every quarter.
Discount Off the Regulated Tariff Plans provide a fixed discount off the regulated tariff, but the electricity rates will change in tandem with the regulated tariff. These plans are more suitable for consumers who do not mind changes in electricity rates every quarter so long as it is lower than the regulated tariff.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/what-is-the-electricity-tariff)

What is the electricity tariff?
The electricity tariff is the price at which consumers buy electricity from SP Group. It is reviewed every quarter and is regulated by EMA to reflect the actual cost of electricity. 
For more information on the latest tariff breakdown for the different tension levels, visit the SP Group  website.
With Open Electricity Market, consumers who have switched to buying electricity from a retailer of their choice can enjoy discounts off the regulated tariff. Visit the Open Electricity Market website for more information on your electricity purchase options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-is-the-electricity-tariff-determined)

How is the electricity tariff determined?
There are two key components of the electricity tariff - fuel cost and non-fuel cost. The fuel cost component for each quarter is calculated using the average of daily natural gas prices in the first two-and-a-half month period in the preceding quarter. 
The non-fuel cost component reflects the cost of generating and delivering electricity to homes. It comprises mainly the grid charge, and the capital and operating costs of generation companies. There is a time lag in the gas price reflected in the electricity tariff because changes in gas prices in the current quarter will only be taken into account in the next quarter's tariff. 
This means that any increase or decrease in gas prices in the current quarter will only be reflected in the next quarter’s tariff. Refer here for more information.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/why-cant-large-consumers-buy-electricity-at-the-regulated-tariff-from-sp-group)

Why can't large consumers buy electricity at the regulated tariff from SP Group?
Electricity offered through the regulated tariff is purchased by SP through existing vesting contracts with gencos. There is a limited quantity of such electricity and we have reserved them for households and small business consumers, who traditionally do not have the bargaining power to negotiate for better retail prices.
Allowing large consumers to switch to the regulated tariff means that SP Group will need to contract for additional supply with gencos at higher prices, and/or buy additional supply of electricity from the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market at the prevailing Uniform Singapore Energy Price, which will cause the regulated tariff to rise.
Households and small consumers would have to bear the costs of price stability for large consumers. Instead, EMA has been engaging generation companies (gencos) to try to plug the shortfall in retail contracts as well as work with the gencos to engage companies when these additional retail contracts become available.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-am-i-billed-for-my-electricity-consumption)

How am I billed for my electricity consumption?
Your electricity consumption is based on the readings on your electricity meters which are read bi-monthly by SP Group. 
For months when your meters are not read, your electricity usage will be estimated based on past consumption.  Any over- or under-estimation of the readings will be adjusted in subsequent bills when the actual meter reading is taken.  
You can submit meter readings via these channels:

The SP App
Call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000. Please press 4 after selecting the language options to submit your meter reading. 

Note that if your meter reading is due on a weekend or public holiday, please use the SP App or call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000 to submit it instead.

Under the Code of Conduct for Retail Electricity Licensees, the exiting retailer is required to approach other retailers to take on their customers under the same contractual terms and conditions. These consumers will be given the option to accept or reject the transfer, or switch to another retailer of their own choice. The exiting retailer's customers will be transferred to buy electricity from SP Group as a last resort, as part of the standard process for retailers who are exiting the business.
After being transferred to SP Group, you may choose to switch to another retailer at any time. The new retailer will work directly with SP Group to make the switch for you. However, the price of electricity may be higher than before, given the current market conditions.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/consumer-safeguards/why-do-some-retailers-choose-to-exit-the-retail-electricity-market)

Why do some retailers choose to exit the retail electricity market?
In an open and liberalised electricity market, retailers may exit the market or the consolidation of players could occur due to market competition. The global energy crunch in late 2021 resulted in high and volatile wholesale electricity prices in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market, which spilled over to the electricity retail market. As a result, independent retailers were affected, which led to some of them exiting the market or prematurely terminated consumer contracts.
Below is the default arrangement for consumers whose retailers have decided to exit the market:

Households and small businesses with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh that are transferred to SP Group will buy electricity at the regulated tariff.
Large businesses with an average monthly consumption above 4MWh will be automatically transferred to SP Group to buy electricity at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer.

You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits their needs before the transfer and are able to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should take note that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is dependent on the prevailing market conditions.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/what-is-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker-rccb-and-where-is-it-located-in-my-home)

What is a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) and where is it located in my home?
The Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) or commonly known as the circuit breaker is an electrical safety device that cuts off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock. Current leakages can be caused by factors such as ageing or exposed wires, faulty electrical appliances, and damaged insulation.
The RCCB is usually located in the distribution board (also known as DB box) or circuit breaker box in your home. It can be identified as a switch with a ‘Test’ button. For HDB residents who are unable to locate your RCCB, please contact your Branch Service Line at 1800-225-5432.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/is-it-compulsory-to-install-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker-rccb-in-my-home)

Is it compulsory to install a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) in my home?
Yes, if you do not already have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) installed in your home. To enhance electrical safety in all households, all residential premises without a circuit breaker will be required to install an RCCB.
All homeowners will be given a grace period of two years, till 1 July 2025 to do so. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.

I have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) in my home. Do I need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB)?
If you have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) installed in your home, you do not need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB). Both the ELCB and RCCB are electrical safety devices that cut off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock.
Homeowners with RCCBs or ELCBs are advised to test that their circuit breaker is in working condition using a 3-step test. This is to ensure that the circuit breaker is functional and protects all electrical circuits in the home.
If the circuit breaker is not working, homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to replace the circuit breaker. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/how-do-i-test-whether-my-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-or-residual-current-circuit-breaker-is-working)

How do I test whether my Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working?
You can perform the following 3-step test to ensure your Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working and protects all electrical circuits in your home.

Test the ELCB or RCCB by pressing the ‘Test’ button. The ELCB or RCCB switch will flip down and cut off all power supply in your home. If the ELCB or RCCB switch does not flip down, it is faulty. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Test all light switches and power sockets in every room. The ELCB or RCCB is working if lights and power sockets do not turn on when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down. If any light or power socket continues to work when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down, the house is not fully protected by the circuit breaker. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Flip up ELCB or RCCB switch to restore power supply. Switch on lights and appliances that you need.

For a detailed step-by-step guide, please visit our RCCB Safety. You are advised to test your ELCB or RCCB once a month to check that it is in good working condition.
All homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to install an RCCB if necessary. It is recommended to contact a few LEWs to perform price comparisons before engaging one. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-are-advanced-electricity-meters)

What are advanced electricity meters?
Advanced electricity meters, also known as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) meters, are digital meters which allow electricity consumption to be registered at half-hourly intervals. To empower households to use electricity more efficiently, advanced electricity meters will be installed across Singapore by 2024. Visit this page to find out more about the metering options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-is-the-difference-between-a-cumulative-and-an-advanced-electricity-meter)

What is the difference between a cumulative and an advanced electricity meter?
Most residential premises today use cumulative meters to measure electricity consumption. Cumulative meters are read once every two months when SP Group sends a meter reader to your premises to record your electricity usage. On the month when your meter is not read, SP Group will estimate the month's consumption based on the methodology approved by EMA.
Advanced electricity meters allow electricity consumption to be measured at half-hourly intervals and you can track your consumption via the SP app. With these meters, you will also have the option* to be billed based on your actual consumption, instead of estimated consumption, on alternate months.
*Not applicable to households that continue to buy electricity at the regulated tariff rate.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/open-electricity-market/what-is-the-open-electricity-market)

What is the Open Electricity Market?
In the Open Electricity Market, consumers will be able to buy electricity from retailers of their choice at price plans that best meet their needs. Those who prefer to stay with SP Group to buy electricity at the regulated tariff can continue to do so. Switching to a retailer is not compulsory, and there is no deadline to switch to a retailer.
Consumers can use the Price Comparison Tool on the Open Electricity Market website to compare the standard price plans offered by retailers. You can also look at the retailer ratings which are based on the feedback gathered from EMA's Consumer Satisfaction Surveys.
There are two types of standard price plans:

Fixed Price Plans are more suitable for consumers who prefer a constant electricity rate throughout the contract duration. The electricity rate may be higher or lower than the regulated tariff during the contract duration, as the regulated tariff is reviewed every quarter.
Discount Off the Regulated Tariff Plans provide a fixed discount off the regulated tariff, but the electricity rates will change in tandem with the regulated tariff. These plans are more suitable for consumers who do not mind changes in electricity rates every quarter so long as it is lower than the regulated tariff.

The Open Electricity Market is about providing consumers with more choices and flexibility when buying electricity. Consumers who have switched continue to enjoy electricity rates lower than the regulated tariff. They have also enjoyed innovative offers from retailers. There is no basis for EMA to reverse this initiative.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/are-electricity-prices-in-singapore-subsidised)

Are electricity prices in Singapore subsidised?
In Singapore, the price of electricity is not subsidised. This is to price energy correctly so that consumers are incentivised to use electricity efficiently and avoid wasteful consumption. 
The Government recognises that there are households which may face difficulties coping with the rising cost of utilities and is ready to help them. In this regard, the Government assists HDB households with their utilities bills payment through the Utilities-Save (U-Save) scheme, with higher amounts of rebates going to lower-income households.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/what-is-the-electricity-tariff)

What is the electricity tariff?
The electricity tariff is the price at which consumers buy electricity from SP Group. It is reviewed every quarter and is regulated by EMA to reflect the actual cost of electricity. 
For more information on the latest tariff breakdown for the different tension levels, visit the SP Group  website.
With Open Electricity Market, consumers who have switched to buying electricity from a retailer of their choice can enjoy discounts off the regulated tariff. Visit the Open Electricity Market website for more information on your electricity purchase options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-is-the-electricity-tariff-determined)

How is the electricity tariff determined?
There are two key components of the electricity tariff - fuel cost and non-fuel cost. The fuel cost component for each quarter is calculated using the average of daily natural gas prices in the first two-and-a-half month period in the preceding quarter. 
The non-fuel cost component reflects the cost of generating and delivering electricity to homes. It comprises mainly the grid charge, and the capital and operating costs of generation companies. There is a time lag in the gas price reflected in the electricity tariff because changes in gas prices in the current quarter will only be taken into account in the next quarter's tariff. 
This means that any increase or decrease in gas prices in the current quarter will only be reflected in the next quarter’s tariff. Refer here for more information.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/why-cant-large-consumers-buy-electricity-at-the-regulated-tariff-from-sp-group)

Why can't large consumers buy electricity at the regulated tariff from SP Group?
Electricity offered through the regulated tariff is purchased by SP through existing vesting contracts with gencos. There is a limited quantity of such electricity and we have reserved them for households and small business consumers, who traditionally do not have the bargaining power to negotiate for better retail prices.
Allowing large consumers to switch to the regulated tariff means that SP Group will need to contract for additional supply with gencos at higher prices, and/or buy additional supply of electricity from the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market at the prevailing Uniform Singapore Energy Price, which will cause the regulated tariff to rise.
Households and small consumers would have to bear the costs of price stability for large consumers. Instead, EMA has been engaging generation companies (gencos) to try to plug the shortfall in retail contracts as well as work with the gencos to engage companies when these additional retail contracts become available.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-prices/how-am-i-billed-for-my-electricity-consumption)

How am I billed for my electricity consumption?
Your electricity consumption is based on the readings on your electricity meters which are read bi-monthly by SP Group. 
For months when your meters are not read, your electricity usage will be estimated based on past consumption.  Any over- or under-estimation of the readings will be adjusted in subsequent bills when the actual meter reading is taken.  
You can submit meter readings via these channels:

The SP App
Call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000. Please press 4 after selecting the language options to submit your meter reading. 

Note that if your meter reading is due on a weekend or public holiday, please use the SP App or call the Open Electricity Market hotline at 1800-233-8000 to submit it instead.

If your retailer bills you directly, your meter reading can also be submitted through the e-Services portal. Sign up for an e-Services account now to start doing so.
If you are still receiving your electricity bill from SP Group, submit your meter reading via the SP Utilities Portal.

The regulated tariff is for household and small business consumers with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh only.
For large businesses with an average monthly consumption of at least 4MWh, your account will be automatically transferred to SP Group at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer. You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits your business needs before the transfer. You can choose to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should be aware that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is representative of the current energy climate.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/consumer-safeguards/why-do-some-retailers-choose-to-exit-the-retail-electricity-market)

Why do some retailers choose to exit the retail electricity market?
In an open and liberalised electricity market, retailers may exit the market or the consolidation of players could occur due to market competition. The global energy crunch in late 2021 resulted in high and volatile wholesale electricity prices in the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market, which spilled over to the electricity retail market. As a result, independent retailers were affected, which led to some of them exiting the market or prematurely terminated consumer contracts.
Below is the default arrangement for consumers whose retailers have decided to exit the market:

Households and small businesses with an average monthly consumption of less than 4 MWh that are transferred to SP Group will buy electricity at the regulated tariff.
Large businesses with an average monthly consumption above 4MWh will be automatically transferred to SP Group to buy electricity at the wholesale electricity price upon the exit of your retailer.

You are advised to approach other retailers directly to find a price plan that best suits their needs before the transfer and are able to transfer out of SP Group at any time. However, you should take note that retail contracts will likely be at a price higher than the previous contract, which is dependent on the prevailing market conditions.

I have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) in my home. Do I need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB)?
If you have an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) installed in your home, you do not need to change it to a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB). Both the ELCB and RCCB are electrical safety devices that cut off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock.
Homeowners with RCCBs or ELCBs are advised to test that their circuit breaker is in working condition using a 3-step test. This is to ensure that the circuit breaker is functional and protects all electrical circuits in the home.
If the circuit breaker is not working, homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to replace the circuit breaker. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/how-do-i-test-whether-my-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-or-residual-current-circuit-breaker-is-working)

How do I test whether my Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working?
You can perform the following 3-step test to ensure your Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working and protects all electrical circuits in your home.

Test the ELCB or RCCB by pressing the ‘Test’ button. The ELCB or RCCB switch will flip down and cut off all power supply in your home. If the ELCB or RCCB switch does not flip down, it is faulty. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Test all light switches and power sockets in every room. The ELCB or RCCB is working if lights and power sockets do not turn on when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down. If any light or power socket continues to work when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down, the house is not fully protected by the circuit breaker. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Flip up ELCB or RCCB switch to restore power supply. Switch on lights and appliances that you need.

For a detailed step-by-step guide, please visit our RCCB Safety. You are advised to test your ELCB or RCCB once a month to check that it is in good working condition.
All homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to install an RCCB if necessary. It is recommended to contact a few LEWs to perform price comparisons before engaging one. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-are-advanced-electricity-meters)

What are advanced electricity meters?
Advanced electricity meters, also known as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) meters, are digital meters which allow electricity consumption to be registered at half-hourly intervals. To empower households to use electricity more efficiently, advanced electricity meters will be installed across Singapore by 2024. Visit this page to find out more about the metering options.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/what-is-the-difference-between-a-cumulative-and-an-advanced-electricity-meter)

What is the difference between a cumulative and an advanced electricity meter?
Most residential premises today use cumulative meters to measure electricity consumption. Cumulative meters are read once every two months when SP Group sends a meter reader to your premises to record your electricity usage. On the month when your meter is not read, SP Group will estimate the month's consumption based on the methodology approved by EMA.
Advanced electricity meters allow electricity consumption to be measured at half-hourly intervals and you can track your consumption via the SP app. With these meters, you will also have the option* to be billed based on your actual consumption, instead of estimated consumption, on alternate months.
*Not applicable to households that continue to buy electricity at the regulated tariff rate.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electricity-supply-and-meters/are-there-any-costs-involved-for-the-meter-replacement)

Are there any costs involved for the meter replacement?
Advanced electricity meter costs are recovered as part of providing grid infrastructure services, which are part of electricity rates charged to households. There are no other separate costs involved.
With access to their electricity consumption via the SP Utilities mobile app, households can take steps to manage their usage more efficiently and enjoy savings as a result.

## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/what-is-a-residual-current-circuit-breaker-rccb-and-where-is-it-located-in-my-home)

What is a Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) and where is it located in my home?
The Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) or commonly known as the circuit breaker is an electrical safety device that cuts off the electricity supply immediately upon detecting leakages that may result in an electric shock. Current leakages can be caused by factors such as ageing or exposed wires, faulty electrical appliances, and damaged insulation.
The RCCB is usually located in the distribution board (also known as DB box) or circuit breaker box in your home. It can be identified as a switch with a ‘Test’ button. For HDB residents who are unable to locate your RCCB, please contact your Branch Service Line at 1800-225-5432.


## EMA FAQs: Electricity (Source: https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/faqs/electricity/electrical-safety/how-do-i-test-whether-my-earth-leakage-circuit-breaker-or-residual-current-circuit-breaker-is-working)

How do I test whether my Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working?
You can perform the following 3-step test to ensure your Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) or Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is working and protects all electrical circuits in your home.

Test the ELCB or RCCB by pressing the ‘Test’ button. The ELCB or RCCB switch will flip down and cut off all power supply in your home. If the ELCB or RCCB switch does not flip down, it is faulty. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Test all light switches and power sockets in every room. The ELCB or RCCB is working if lights and power sockets do not turn on when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down. If any light or power socket continues to work when the circuit breaker switch is flipped down, the house is not fully protected by the circuit breaker. Homeowners should contact a Licensed Electrical Worker for assistance immediately.
Flip up ELCB or RCCB switch to restore power supply. Switch on lights and appliances that you need.

For a detailed step-by-step guide, please visit our RCCB Safety. You are advised to test your ELCB or RCCB once a month to check that it is in good working condition.
All homeowners can engage a Licensed Electrical Worker to install an RCCB if necessary. It is recommended to contact a few LEWs to perform price comparisons before engaging one. HDB will be writing to the homeowners of 3-room and larger flat types, completed in and before 1985 without an RCCB, to share more information on the assistance programme for the installation of RCCB.
