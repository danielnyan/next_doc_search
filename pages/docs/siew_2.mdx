## S’pore a step closer to using low-carbon ammonia for bunkering, power generation (Link: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/s-pore-a-step-closer-to-using-low-carbon-ammonia-for-bunkering-power-generation)

SINGAPORE - The Republic is about to embark on one of the first commercial projects in the world to utilise ammonia for bunkering and power generation, after setting its sights on using hydrogen for about 50 per cent of its energy needs by 2050.

Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said on Monday that the technology for transporting ammonia as well as an international supply chain are well established.

He was speaking on the first day of the Singapore International Energy Week at Marina Bay Sands. The event will run until Friday.

“Ammonia also has the potential to be used directly as fuel for power generation and maritime shipping,” Mr Gan added.

Ammonia is formed when hydrogen combines with nitrogen from ambient air. It is an energy-efficient way of transporting large amounts of hydrogen over long distances while taking up little space.

Hydrogen is seen as a clean fuel as it does not produce any planet-warming carbon dioxide when burnt.

What is Singapore doing to engage the commercial sector to experiment with hydrogen technology?

The project will involve developing an end-to-end ammonia solution to generate 55 to 65 megawatts of electricity from imported low-carbon or zero-carbon ammonia via direct combustion in a gas turbine or combined cycle gas turbine, said the Energy Market Authority (EMA) on Monday.

The project will be located on Jurong Island.

The project developer, which will be working closely with the Government, will also have to facilitate ammonia bunkering at a capacity of at least 0.1 million tons per annum, starting with shore-to-ship bunkering followed by ship-to-ship bunkering.

Since EMA and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) launched an invitation for Expressions of Interest (EOI) for the project in December 2022, a total of 26 proposals have been received from local and foreign companies, said Mr Gan.

Six consortia have been shortlisted to participate in the next step - a Request for Proposal (RFP) to be launched by end-2023 to help the government choose a lead developer for the project.

While the Government is experimenting with advanced hydrogen technologies that are almost commercially ready through such projects, it is also exploring other low-carbon energy sources, such as nuclear energy, said Mr Gan.

In terms of exploring low carbon technologies, what are some nuclear technologies that Singapore is currently exploring? 

Though no decision has yet been made on deploying nuclear power here, the Government still needs to build capabilities to understand advanced nuclear energy technologies that are becoming safer and have the potential to be cost-competitive, he added.

This will allow the authorities to study the options seriously when newer technologies later prove to be viable, said Mr Gan, who noted that there is a growing interest in nuclear energy among countries in the region.

“We have been engaging international organisations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to learn from the world’s best, and we are working with our neighbours through Asean platforms to facilitate information-sharing and collectively build up the region’s capabilities,” said the minister.

For instance, the Republic is building up expertise to develop advanced nuclear technologies and their suitability for Singapore, such as small modular reactors (SMR).

These reactors harness nuclear fission to generate heat and produce energy, and have a power capacity of up to 300 megawatt per unit, about one third the generation capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors, according to the IAEA.

Mr Gan noted that some SMRs are designed to cool safely and passively without requiring external systems or operator actions during emergencies.

“We will deepen our collaboration with countries that have capabilities in SMR technology to strengthen our understanding,” said Mr Gan.

Aside from solar, hydrogen and nuclear, what are other renewable or low carbon energies that Singapore is exploring?

At the same time, studies have been launched to better understand if Singapore could rely on geothermal heat to generate electricity, after a study by the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) found that a site near Sembawang hot springs could be a geothermal energy source at depths of 4 to 5km.

Studies are also underway to determine whether biofuels can be more widely adopted across different carbon-intensive sectors, said Mr Gan.

Biofuels have been supplied to ocean-going vessels, and blended sustainable aviation fuel - made from used cooking oil and animal flights - has been used for all Singapore Airlines flights.

Professor Subodh Mhaisalkar, who is the executive director of academic research at the National Research Foundation, said that ammonia could be a fuel for both power generation and shipping for years to come, before other hydrogen carrier alternatives such as liquefied hydrogen or methanol could be considered.

“There are many challenges in the utilisation of ammonia and these include transport, storage, safety, emissions management, and optimisation of both marine and power generation plants. These trials would place Singapore in a leading position in demonstrating the use of ammonia for power generation in a megacity environment,” he added.

In the short term, biofuels would be of great importance for land transport, maritime applications, and as aviation fuel.

“Over the longer term, other clean energies such as geothermal and nuclear that have the potential of scaling would be important to consider,” said Prof Mhaisalkar. 

## No decision on use of nuclear energy yet, Singapore to keep options open (Link: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nuclear-energy-singapore-low-carbon-hydrogen-ammonia-gan-kim-yong-3864951?cid=internal_sharetool_iphone_23102023_cna)
SINGAPORE: Singapore has not made any decision to deploy nuclear energy yet but must keep its options open and build expertise in the area, Ministry for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said on Monday (Oct 23) during the Singapore International Energy Week. 

Mr Gan said on the first day of the annual event that Singapore was exploring low-carbon energy sources, including hydrogen and nuclear energy

The use of nuclear energy was one of three possible scenarios previously set out by Singapore in its Energy 2050 Committee Report released last year. The report identified nuclear energy as a potential power source to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, with this form of energy potentially able to supply about 10 per cent of the country's needs. 

However, Mr Gan stressed that Singapore had yet to make a decision about nuclear energy. Instead, Singapore has been growing its capabilities in nuclear safety, emergency preparedness and response.

Singapore conducted a pre-feasibility study on nuclear energy more than 10 years ago which concluded that technologies available then were not suitable for deployment in Singapore, the minister said.

"But we need to build capabilities to understand advanced nuclear energy technologies that are becoming safer and have the potential to be cost competitive, this way we can study the options seriously when these newer technologies become viable."

He noted growing interest in nuclear energy from other countries in the region.

To better equip itself, Singapore has been engaging international organisations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and worked with neighbouring countries to "facilitate information-sharing" and "collectively build up the region’s capabilities". 

The government is also studying advanced nuclear technologies and their suitability for Singapore. One example is small modular reactors, which Mr Gan said showed promise in being safer than conventional large-scale reactors.

Small modular reactors are designed to cool safely and passively without requiring external systems or operator actions during emergencies, Mr Gan added. 

"We will deepen our collaboration with countries that have capabilities in small modular reactor technology to strengthen our understanding of these technologies."

Apart from nuclear energy, Singapore has reached another milestone in an alternative form of low-carbon energy, hydrogen, with the launch of the next stage of selection of low or zero-carbon ammonia power generation and bunkering project developer. 

The Energy Market Authority and Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore have shortlisted six consortiums whose proposals will be further developed in a closed Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide a low or zero-carbon ammonia solution for power generation and bunkering on Jurong Island.

The Request for Proposal follows the Expression of Interest that spanned December last year to end-April this year, where a total of 26 proposals from local and foreign companies were received. Six proposals were shortlisted based on technical, land optimisation, safety, and commercial aspects for a closed Request for Proposal.

Last year, Singapore announced its National Hydrogen Strategy, which aims to experiment with the use of advanced hydrogen technologies that are on the cusp of commercial readiness.

Among hydrogen carriers, ammonia is more technologically ready, with an established international supply chain, Mr Gan noted.

Based on the Request for Proposal, the government will identify a lead developer to jointly develop the project, which will be one of the first commercial projects in the world to test and deploy the use of ammonia as a fuel. 

Jointly, the lead developer and the authorities will develop an end-to-end ammonia solution which comprises generating 55 to 65 megawatts of electricity from imported low or zero-carbon ammonia via direct combustion in a gas turbine or combined cycle gas turbine; and facilitating ammonia bunkering at a capacity of at least 0.1 million tons per annum, starting with shore-to-ship bunkering followed by ship-to-ship bunkering. 

The Request for Proposal will be launched before the end of this year.
